### Hi there I'm an undergraduated computer science student at Dartmouth College (class of 2024).
### I'm interested in Machine Learning, and have been a machine learning engineer at Matterworks for over a year, a venture-backed startup revolutionizing metabolomics by integrating ML into the Mass Spectrometry workflow.
### I am also a researcher at Dartmouth-Hitchock Medical Center (DHMC), where I apply machine-learning techniques (Self-Supervised Learning, Computer Vision) to radiation-oncology related problems
### In my free time I like to re-implement papers that interest me and which (when I write the code at least) do not have any other implementations online. I am especially interested in re-implementing self-supervised and representation learning architectures!
